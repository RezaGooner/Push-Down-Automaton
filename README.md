# Push-Down-Automaton

This repository contains an implementation of a **Push-Down Automaton (PDA)**, a type of computational model used in formal language theory. PDAs are essential in recognizing context-free languages (CFLs) and are often used in the study of compilers, parsing algorithms, and language processing.

## Features
- **Push-Down Automaton Simulation:** A basic PDA simulation for processing strings.
- **Context-Free Language Recognition:** The implementation demonstrates how PDAs can recognize context-free languages, focusing on strings like `a^n b^n`.
- **Educational Purpose:** Ideal for students and learners of computational theory to understand the workings of PDAs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RezaGooner/Push-Down-Automaton.git
   ```

2. **Compile the code:**
   Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Compile the source code with:
   ```bash
   g++ -o pda pda.cpp
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   ./pda
   ```

## Example Usage

To test a string, input the string as a sequence of characters. For example, `aaabbb` will be accepted by the PDA if it follows the context-free grammar.

## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute by submitting issues or pull requests to improve the implementation.
